# Introduction

- Code is ever changing, so rather than try to optimize for maximum performance now, optimize for maintainability. For the lifetime of the project, it allows for:
  - Reduced cost
  - Increase productivity

# Chapter 1 - Object Oriented Design

- The world is not a set of predefined procedures, rather a series of messages that pass between objects
- Software that will never change does not need design
- OOD is about managing dependencies, ensuring your application is resilient against changing dependencies
- Purpose of design is to allow you to design later, reducing cost of change
- Design Principles
  - SOLID
  - DRY
  - Law of Demeter
- Design Patterns
  - "Each well-known pattern is a near perfect open-source solution for the problem it solves"
- Bad OOD metrics are a sign of bade design, but code that scores well doesn't provde the code is good. You may have writen perfect design for the wrong future, hindering your ability to change to the new future.
- There are 2 fundamental building blocks in programming, _data_ and _behaivor_. OOD combines these 2 to create an _object_.
  - Objects invoke each others' behaivors by sending _messages_

# Chapter 2 - Designing Classes with a Single Responsibility
