# Introduction

- Code is ever changing, so rather than try to optimize for maximum performance now, optimize for maintainability. For the lifetime of the project, it allows for:
  - Reduced cost
  - Increase productivity

# Chapter 1 - Object Oriented Design

- The world is not a set of predefined procedures, rather a series of messages that pass between objects
- Software that will never change does not need design
- OOD is about managing dependencies, ensuring your application is resilient against changing dependencies
- Purpose of design is to allow you to design later, reducing cost of change
- Design Principles
  - SOLID
  - DRY
  - Law of Demeter
- Design Patterns
  - "Each well-known pattern is a near perfect open-source solution for the problem it solves"
